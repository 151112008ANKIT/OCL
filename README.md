# SMT Solvers: Z3 and CVC5

## Introduction
This repository provides instructions for installing and using two popular SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers: Z3 and CVC5. These solvers can be used for formal verification, constraint solving, and other computational logic tasks.

## Z3 SMT Solver

### Installation
To install Z3, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official [Z3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git
   cd z3
   
## Usage
Once Z3 is installed, you can use it via the command line or through its APIs in various programming languages such as Python, C++, and .NET.

Command Line
To use Z3 from the command line, navigate to the build directory in your Z3 installation and run the z3 executable. You can provide input files containing SMT-LIB or Z3-specific scripts as arguments.
3. Example:
   ```sh
/path/to/z3/build/z3 input.smt2

# CVC5 SMT Solver

## Introduction
This repository provides instructions for installing and using the CVC5 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. CVC5 can be used for formal verification, constraint solving, and other computational logic tasks.

## Installation
To install CVC5, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official [CVC5 GitHub repository](https://github.com/CVC5/CVC5).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CVC5/CVC5.git


## Usage

Once CVC5 is installed, you can use it via the command line or through its APIs in various programming languages such as C++, Python, and Java.

Example:
/path/to/cvc5/cvc5 input.smt2
